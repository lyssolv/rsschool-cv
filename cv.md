### Summary
I have more than 7 years of experience in non-IT industries such as logistics, finance, and statistics. This experience has not only helped me to develop an important ability to function well as a team member but also taught me how to take a lead and finish any assigned task or project. 
While working at _SoftConstruct_ - one of the largest IT companies in Armenia, I developed an interest in frontend web development. Later I started learning __JavaScript__ on my own as well as took courses in __HTML, CSS, & JavaScript__. While my practical knowledge is basic so far, my desire to learn and motivation will ensure good results and productive cooperation. 
With the increasing demand for IT specialists in Lithuania and my passion for it I believe I am going to have big achievements.
